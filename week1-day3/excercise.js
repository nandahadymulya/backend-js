// Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.
// For each multiple of 3, print “Talent" instead of the number.
// For each multiple of 5, print “Pedia" instead of the number.
// For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print “TalentPedia" instead of the number.

// Create a function for check a palindrome string

// Create a function that calculates only the odd values in a sequence of numbers, given the min and max sequence value as inputs. Example:
// min = 1, max = 8, result = 16 (1+3+5+7)
// min = 4, max = 15, result = 60 (5+7+9+11+13+15)
